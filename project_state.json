  "summary": "Add a full-screen 3D curtain intro overlay that blocks the entire page on initial load; it reveals the site only after first user click/touch. Fix curtain show/persistence behavior per clarified 'show every time they visit the app' requirement (not necessarily every refresh). Fix a scrolling bug where geometric-border sections near the middle prevent scrolling. Add true infinite-scroll behavior by auto-duplicating the entire long single-page's sections as the user scrolls so the page never ends. Fix Vercel deployment blank-load issue by using environment-based Vite base-path config (Vercel '/' vs downloadable/non-root './').",
  "architectural_notes": [
    "Single-page-only approach: implement all added ‘department’ content as stacked sections on one very long scrolling static page (no routing / no multi-page navigation).",
    "Preserve the existing onboarding layout at the top; all new content is appended below it in order.",
    "Visual direction is intentionally over-ornamented/chaotic: dense borders, heavy gold/red parchment styling, floral/ancient motifs; explicitly do not optimize for standard UX/design best practices.",
    "All new content must be appended as additional sections on the same single scrolling page (no new pages/routes), without replacing or reorganizing existing sections.",
    "New absurd media sections should embed real/generated media files (video/audio) as static assets bundled with the frontend (e.g., under frontend/public/assets/generated), not just placeholders.",
    "Typography should be intentionally inconsistent/mismatched across sections while maintaining the overall ancient gold/red parchment + heavily floral/religious ornamentation and chaotic ‘worst-designed’ aesthetic.",
    "Add a full-screen golden-flash + Jesus-from-clouds overlay effect that triggers on even slight scroll movement (very frequent), layered above all sections (no routing/pages).",
    "Audio behavior: attempt autoplay for religious-song loops; if blocked, immediately start playback on first user interaction (scroll/click).",
    "Borders across every section dynamically animate/change geometric shapes during scrolling (triangle/pentagon/hexagon/etc.).",
    "New ancient patterns/flowers/figures are added to borders only; keep existing background texture but make it more overloaded/ornate; increase flowery copy and intentionally inconsistent typography."
  ],
  "known_issues": [
    "Using ‘find online’ images may introduce licensing/copyright risk; require user-provided assets or use clearly-licensed/public-domain sources before bundling.",
    "Bug/regression: initial full-screen 3D red/gold curtain overlay never appears on page load.",
    "Bug/regression: lightweight Jesus micro-cameo overlay does not disappear quickly enough (should dismiss on user click).",
    "Bug: certain geometric-border sections near the middle of the long single-page layout stop/lock scrolling.",
    "Curtain persistence/show-frequency requirement is conflicting/unstable in current implementation; must match clarified visit-based behavior.",
    "Bug: when downloading and deploying the built files to a non-root path, background designs/images/curtain assets fail to load due to absolute `/assets/...` URLs causing 404s (Vite base-path mismatch).",
    "Bug: Vercel deployment shows blank page / nothing loads when Vite base is set to './' (relative) causing JS/CSS/assets to resolve incorrectly for root-hosted deploys; requires env-based base switching."
